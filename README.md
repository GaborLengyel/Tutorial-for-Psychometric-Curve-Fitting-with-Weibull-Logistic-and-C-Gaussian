# Tutorial-for-Psychometric-Curve-Fitting-with-Weibull-Logistic-and-C-Gaussian

Simple jupyter notebook that shows how to fit the three classical psychometric functions to 2-AFC data: Weibull, Logistic, and Cummulative Gaussian.
This framework assumes that the discrimination threshold is limited by constant and independent Gaussian noise in accordance with signal-detection theory in its most basic form (Green & Swets, 1966).
